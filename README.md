# Physics-Based Super-Resolved Simulation of 3d Elastic Wave Propagation Adopting Scalable Diffusion Transformer

This repository contains an implementation of the paper : Physics-Based Super-Resolved Simulation of 3d Elastic Wave Propagation Adopting Scalable Diffusion Transformer. 

## üîç Overview

In this GitHub repository, we provide a checkpoint of the presentend model and an example model for inference in a notebooks.

## üíª	 Setup

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HugoGabrielidis16/Seismic_DiT1D
cd Seismic_DiT1D/
```

Models weights checkpoints are available upon request on the following link : https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16Cqdq72sto_WMix2K2tGRlc997N6nadA
